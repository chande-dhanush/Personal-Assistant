# Personal-Assistant
My personal Assistant chatbot built using Groq API calls for LLaMA 3 - 8b

# Steps to run the code

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a .env file within the Assets folder.
3. Obtain your spotify Api keys from Spotify's Developers page to access your spotify clients
4. Get a Groq API key from groq website
5. Add all the API keys within the .env file
6. U can use Run_sakura.py to run the code once all this is done, it should run unless the API keys are wrong or if the paths were disturbed.
7. make sure to check the contacts.json, if u want to add contacts to send whatsapp messages. I've added a few samples for better understanding
