### User Note
**BeginnerFriendly Fried Chicken Note**

1. **Choose the right chicken**  
   *Use bone‑in pieces (legs, thighs, wings, breasts). Bone‑in keeps meat moist; breasts can dry if overcooked.*
2. **Brine (optional but recommended)**  
   *Mix 1 cup salt, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup water, and optional herbs (bay leaf, peppercorns). Submerge chicken for 24 hrs in the fridge. Rinse and pat dry.*
3. **Season**  
   *Pat chicken dry. Rub with 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, 1 tsp paprika, ½ tsp garlic powder.*
4. **Dredge**  
   *Set up two bowls: dry (flour + seasonings) and wet (beaten eggs + milk). Coat each piece: flour → egg → flour again. Shake off excess.*
5. **Oil & temperature**  
   *Use vegetable or canola oil. Heat to 350‑375 °F (175‑190 °C). Test with a small flour drop; it should sizzle and brown in ~30 s.*
6. **Fry**  
   *Add pieces in batches, don’t overcrowd. Fry 10 min (breast, wings) or 15 min (legs, thighs). Turn halfway. Internal temp should hit 165 °F (74 °C).*
7. **Drain & rest**  
   *Place on a rack over paper towels. Let rest 5 min before serving.*
8. **Tips for crispiness**  
   *Keep oil temperature steady; add a pinch of baking powder to the flour for extra crunch.*
9. **Side dish suggestion**  
   *Cornbread or coleslaw (southern staples).*
